Food Truck Finder is a website that allows users to find locations of food trucks near them. As food trucks are not tied to permanent locations, they don't hold the same prominence as a restaurant, but offer a unique dining experience. The website would allow users to find food trucks nearby when they're around for various events or as part of the food truck's regular schedule.

The idea came from food trucks being unique places to enjoy food, but not having any sense of regularity. When I've seen 20+ food trucks lined up at festivals and other events, it made me wonder where they're stationed at outside of those special occasions.

This is a capstone project as part of my LaunchCode education. The project is currently in progress and far from any status of completion.
